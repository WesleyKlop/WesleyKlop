I am Wesley Klop, a 22-year-old student living in the Netherlands who is currently pursuing a BsC in Computer Science at [Hogeschool Leiden].
At the moment I'm mostly working on [Laravel] projects, in combination with [Vue].

I also have a passion for working with and managing systems, and for the past few years I've been maintaining my own server running Ubuntu, hosting applications with Docker.

I'm working on becoming a good Full Stack / DevOps-engineer that helps make the world a better place.

My own website can be found at [wesley.io]
